# Starting

Using yarn :

# Tasks 
Implement all functions and constructors
All test should pass (at least i hope, if they are not passing and you are sure that it is correct (mayby I implemented something wrongly) you need to convince me why)
To run tests execute

Using yarn : 

```
yarn test
```


Using npm : 
```
npm tun test
```

Do commits to your own branch as much as possible I want to see a progress

You can debug separate tests using the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner
Read the file to see how to use it

Good luck
